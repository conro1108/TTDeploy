            We are creating a tool called "Threaded Tweeter" which will serve as a tool for computer power users to quickly and easily compose and post threaded tweets. The core product will be a command line tool that allows a user to compose a tweet thread in their preferred text editor, and post to twitter from the comfort of their terminal emulator.
